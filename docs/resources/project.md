# project (Resource)

Provides an Artifactory project resource. This can be used to create and manage Artifactory project, maintain users/groups/roles/repos.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "project" "myproject" {
  key = "myproj"
  display_name = "My Project"
  description  = "My Project"
  admin_privileges {
    manage_members   = true
    manage_resources = true
    index_resources  = true
  }
  max_storage_in_gibibytes   = 10
  block_deployments_on_limit = false
  email_notification         = true

  member {
    name  = "user1"
    roles = ["developer","project admin"]
  }

  member {
    name  = "user2"
    roles = ["developer"]
  }

  group {
    name = "dev-group"
    roles = ["developer"]
  }

  group {
    name = "release-group"
    roles = ["release manager"]
  }

  role {
    name         = "developer"
    description  = "Developer role"
    type         = "CUSTOM"
    environments = ["DEV"]
    actions      = ["READ_REPOSITORY", "ANNOTATE_REPOSITORY", "DEPLOY_CACHE_REPOSITORY", "DELETE_OVERWRITE_REPOSITORY", "TRIGGER_PIPELINE", "READ_INTEGRATIONS_PIPELINE", "READ_POOLS_PIPELINE", "MANAGE_INTEGRATIONS_PIPELINE", "MANAGE_SOURCES_PIPELINE", "MANAGE_POOLS_PIPELINE"]
  }

  role {
    name         = "devop"
    description  = "DevOp role"
    type         = "CUSTOM"
    environments = ["DEV", "PROD"]
    actions      = ["READ_REPOSITORY", "ANNOTATE_REPOSITORY", "DEPLOY_CACHE_REPOSITORY", "DELETE_OVERWRITE_REPOSITORY", "TRIGGER_PIPELINE", "READ_INTEGRATIONS_PIPELINE", "READ_POOLS_PIPELINE", "MANAGE_INTEGRATIONS_PIPELINE", "MANAGE_SOURCES_PIPELINE", "MANAGE_POOLS_PIPELINE", "READ_BUILD", "ANNOTATE_BUILD", "DEPLOY_BUILD", "DELETE_BUILD",]
  }

  repos = ["docker-local", "rpm-local"]
}

## Schema

### Required

- **admin_privileges** (Block Set, Min: 1) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--admin_privileges))
- **display_name** (String) Also known as project name on the UI
- **key** (String, ForceNew) The Project Key is added as a prefix to resources created within a Project. This field is mandatory and supports only 3 - 6 lowercase alphanumeric characters. Must begin with a letter. For example: us1a.

### Optional

- **block_deployments_on_limit** (Boolean) Block artifacts deployment if storage quota is exceeded.
- **description** (String)
- **email_notification** (Boolean) Alerts will be sent when reaching 75% and 95% of the storage quota. Serves as a notification only and is not a blocker
- **group** (Block Set) Project group. Element has one to one mapping with the [JFrog Project Groups API](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Artifactory+REST+API#ArtifactoryRESTAPI-UpdateGroupinProject) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--group))
- **id** (String) The ID of this resource.
- **max_storage_in_gibibytes** (Number) Storage quota in GiB. Must be 1 or larger. Set to -1 for unlimited storage. This is translated to binary bytes for Artifactory API. So for 1TB quota, this should be set to 1024 (vs 1000) which will translate to 1099511627776 bytes for the API.
- **member** (Block Set) Member of the project. Element has one to one mapping with the [JFrog Project Users API](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Artifactory+REST+API#ArtifactoryRESTAPI-UpdateUserinProject). (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--member))
- **repos** (Set of String) List of existing repo keys to be assigned to the project. You can set a maximum 100 repo keys. (se [below for limitations on the maximum number of repos](#repoNumLimitations)). You can override the default value by setting an environment value `REPO_LIMIT_OVERRIDE` to `true`. The default value of `REPO_LIMIT_OVERRIDE` is `false` when not set. E.g. To override the default maximum allowable elements of `repos` attribute use `export REPO_LIMIT_OVERRIDE=true`.
- **role** (Block Set) Project role. Element has one to one mapping with the [JFrog Project Roles API](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Artifactory+REST+API#ArtifactoryRESTAPI-AddaNewRole) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--role))

## Note
<a name="repoNumLimitations"></a>
### Limitations of Repository assign/unassign to/from Project
The project provider has limitations on its ability to assign or unassign a large number of repositories through the `repos` attribute. With more than a certain number of repos you might observe system disruptions and all the repositories might not be assigned/unassigned to/from the desired project. As per our analysis, it is **recommended to limit the number of repos to 100** to avoid internal platform limitations. The JFrog Engineering team is working on further improvement to ensure a better user experience.
