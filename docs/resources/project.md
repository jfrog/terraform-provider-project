## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "project" "myproject" {
  key = "myproj"
  display_name = "My Project"
  description  = "My Project"
  admin_privileges {
    manage_members   = true
    manage_resources = true
    index_resources  = true
  }
  max_storage_in_gibibytes   = 10
  block_deployments_on_limit = false
  email_notification         = true

  member {
    name  = "user1"
    roles = ["developer","project admin"]
  }

  member {
    name  = "user2"
    roles = ["developer"]
  }

  group {
    name = "dev-group"
    roles = ["developer"]
  }

  group {
    name = "release-group"
    roles = ["release manager"]
  }

  role {
    name         = "developer"
    description  = "Developer role"
    type         = "CUSTOM"
    environments = ["DEV"]
    actions      = ["READ_REPOSITORY", "ANNOTATE_REPOSITORY", "DEPLOY_CACHE_REPOSITORY", "DELETE_OVERWRITE_REPOSITORY", "TRIGGER_PIPELINE", "READ_INTEGRATIONS_PIPELINE", "READ_POOLS_PIPELINE", "MANAGE_INTEGRATIONS_PIPELINE", "MANAGE_SOURCES_PIPELINE", "MANAGE_POOLS_PIPELINE"]
  }

  role {
    name         = "devop"

## Schema

### Required

- **admin_privileges** (Block Set, Min: 1) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--admin_privileges))
- **display_name** (String) Also known as project name on the UI
- **key** (String, ForceNew) The Project Key is added as a prefix to resources created within a Project. This field is mandatory and supports only 3 - 6 lowercase alphanumeric characters. Must begin with a letter. For example: us1a.

### Optional

- **block_deployments_on_limit** (Boolean) Block artifacts deployment if storage quota is exceeded.
- **description** (String)
- **email_notification** (Boolean) Alerts will be sent when reaching 75% and 95% of the storage quota. Serves as a notification only and is not a blocker
- **group** (Block Set) Project group. Element has one to one mapping with the [JFrog Project Groups API](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Artifactory+REST+API#ArtifactoryRESTAPI-UpdateGroupinProject) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--group))
- **id** (String) The ID of this resource.
- **max_storage_in_gibibytes** (Number) Storage quota in GiB. Must be 1 or larger. Set to -1 for unlimited storage. This is translated to binary bytes for Artifactory API. So for 1TB quota, this should be set to 1024 (vs 1000) which will translate to 1099511627776 bytes for the API.
- **member** (Block Set) Member of the project. Element has one to one mapping with the [JFrog Project Users API](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Artifactory+REST+API#ArtifactoryRESTAPI-UpdateUserinProject). (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--member))
- **repos** (Set of String) List of existing repo keys to be assigned to the project.
- **role** (Block Set) Project role. Element has one to one mapping with the [JFrog Project Roles API](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Artifactory+REST+API#ArtifactoryRESTAPI-AddaNewRole) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--role))

## Note
### Limitations of Repository assign/unassign to/from Project 
Project provider has limitations to assign or unassign large number of repositories through `repos` attribute. With more than a certain number of repos you might observe system disruptions and all the repositories might not get assigned/unassigned to/from desired project. As per our analysis, it is **recommended to limit the number of repos within 100** to get a desired result. JFrog Engineering team is working on further improvement to ensure better user experience.
