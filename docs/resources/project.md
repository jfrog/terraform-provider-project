# project (Resource)

Provides an Artifactory project resource. This can be used to create and manage Artifactory project, maintain users/groups/roles/repos.

## Repository Configuration

After the project configuration is applied with `repos` attribute set, the repository's attributes `project_key` and `project_environments` would be updated with the project's data. This will generate a state drift in the next Terraform plan/apply for the repository resource. To avoid this, apply `lifecycle.ignore_changes`:

```hcl
resource "artifactory_local_maven_repository" "my_maven_releases" {
	key = "my-maven-releases"
	...

	lifecycle {
		ignore_changes = [
			project_environments,
			project_key
		]
	}
}
```

~>We strongly recommend using the `project_repository` resource instead to manage the list of repositories.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "project" "myproject" {
  key = "myproj"
  display_name = "My Project"
  description  = "My Project"
  admin_privileges {
    manage_members   = true
    manage_resources = true
    index_resources  = true
  }
  max_storage_in_gibibytes   = 10
  block_deployments_on_limit = false
  email_notification         = true
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `display_name` (String) Also known as project name on the UI
- `key` (String) The Project Key is added as a prefix to resources created within a Project. This field is mandatory and supports only 2 - 32 lowercase alphanumeric and hyphen characters. Must begin with a letter. For example: `us1a-test`.
- `admin_privileges` (Block Set) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--admin_privileges))

### Optional

- `block_deployments_on_limit` (Boolean) Block deployment of artifacts if storage quota is exceeded.

~>This setting only applies to self-hosted environment. See [Manage Storage Quotas](https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-platform-administration-documentation/manage-storage-quotas).
- `description` (String)
- `email_notification` (Boolean) Alerts will be sent when reaching 75% and 95% of the storage quota. This serves as a notification only and is not a blocker
- `group` (Block Set, Deprecated) Project group. Element has one to one mapping with the [JFrog Project Groups API](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Artifactory+REST+API#ArtifactoryRESTAPI-UpdateGroupinProject) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--group))
- `max_storage_in_gibibytes` (Number) Storage quota in GiB. Must be 1 or larger. Set to -1 for unlimited storage. This is translated to binary bytes for Artifactory API. So for a 1TB quota, this should be set to 1024 (vs 1000) which will translate to 1099511627776 bytes for the API.
- `member` (Block Set, Deprecated) Member of the project. Element has one to one mapping with the [JFrog Project Users API](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Artifactory+REST+API#ArtifactoryRESTAPI-UpdateUserinProject). (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--member))
- `repos` (Set of String, Deprecated) (Optional) List of existing repo keys to be assigned to the project. If you wish to use the alternate method of setting `project_key` attribute in each `artifactory_*_repository` resource in the `artifactory` provider, you will need to use `lifecycle.ignore_changes` in the `project` resource to avoid state drift.

```hcl
lifecycle {
	ignore_changes = [
		repos
	]
}
```
- `role` (Block Set, Deprecated) Project role. Element has one to one mapping with the [JFrog Project Roles API](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Artifactory+REST+API#ArtifactoryRESTAPI-AddaNewRole) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--role))
- `use_project_group_resource` (Boolean) When set to true, this resource will ignore the `group` attributes and allow users to be managed by `project_group` resource instead. Default to `true`.
- `use_project_repository_resource` (Boolean) When set to true, this resource will ignore the `repos` attributes and allow repository to be managed by `project_repository` resource instead. Default to `true`.
- `use_project_role_resource` (Boolean) When set to true, this resource will ignore the `roles` attributes and allow roles to be managed by `project_role` resource instead. Default to `true`.
- `use_project_user_resource` (Boolean) When set to true, this resource will ignore the `member` attributes and allow users to be managed by `project_user` resource instead. Default to `true`.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--admin_privileges"></a>
### Nested Schema for `admin_privileges`

Required:

- `index_resources` (Boolean) Enables a project admin to define the resources to be indexed by Xray
- `manage_members` (Boolean) Allows the Project Admin to manage Platform users/groups as project members with different roles.
- `manage_resources` (Boolean) Allows the Project Admin to manage resources - repositories, builds and Pipelines resources on the project level.


<a id="nestedblock--group"></a>
### Nested Schema for `group`

Required:

- `name` (String) Must be existing Artifactory group
- `roles` (Set of String) List of pre-defined Project or custom roles


<a id="nestedblock--member"></a>
### Nested Schema for `member`

Required:

- `name` (String) Must be existing Artifactory user
- `roles` (Set of String) List of pre-defined Project or custom roles


<a id="nestedblock--role"></a>
### Nested Schema for `role`

Required:

- `actions` (Set of String) List of pre-defined actions (READ_REPOSITORY, ANNOTATE_REPOSITORY, DEPLOY_CACHE_REPOSITORY, DELETE_OVERWRITE_REPOSITORY, MANAGE_XRAY_MD_REPOSITORY, READ_RELEASE_BUNDLE, ANNOTATE_RELEASE_BUNDLE, CREATE_RELEASE_BUNDLE, DISTRIBUTE_RELEASE_BUNDLE, DELETE_RELEASE_BUNDLE, MANAGE_XRAY_MD_RELEASE_BUNDLE, READ_BUILD, ANNOTATE_BUILD, DEPLOY_BUILD, DELETE_BUILD, MANAGE_XRAY_MD_BUILD, READ_SOURCES_PIPELINE, TRIGGER_PIPELINE, READ_INTEGRATIONS_PIPELINE, READ_POOLS_PIPELINE, MANAGE_INTEGRATIONS_PIPELINE, MANAGE_SOURCES_PIPELINE, MANAGE_POOLS_PIPELINE, TRIGGER_SECURITY, ISSUES_SECURITY, LICENCES_SECURITY, REPORTS_SECURITY, WATCHES_SECURITY, POLICIES_SECURITY, RULES_SECURITY, MANAGE_MEMBERS, MANAGE_RESOURCES)
- `environments` (Set of String) A repository can be available in different environments. Members with roles defined in the set environment will have access to the repository. List of pre-defined environments (DEV, PROD)
- `name` (String)
